          <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
          
          <h3>Bootcamp edition</h3>
          
          <div class="block"><h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>
              I believe that any workplace gives an opportunity to help people and make a positive impact. 
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="block"><h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
            <p>
              My experience during the foundation proved my initial thoughts about my strengths and limitations with one difference - now I belive I can work on my limitations and improve myself.  
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
            <p>
              I think the most challenging and most interesting will be working in teams.  Also, it will be a challenging time for me because I will not be able to spend a lot of time with my daughter.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
            <p>
              I hope to improve my communication skills and my language.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
            <p>
              Honest feedback is one of the most important things during the Bootcamp. I believe it will help me to see where I need to work more and which aspects of my learning I should pay more attention to.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>be respectful and positive</li>
              <li>do my best in taking care of the feelings of the people around me and in taking care of myself</li>
              <li>listen more and talk less</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="date-and-name">23/07/2022</div>


          <h3>Foundation edition</h3>
            <div class="block"><h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
              <p>I want to get into web development industry and I want to stay there as long as I can. I want to find <i>my</i> place  and get an opportunity to make people's lives better, easier and more enjoyable.  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
              <p>My language is the limitation when it is time to  write something. Compare with an average person, it takes more time and affords for me to put my thoughts on the paper/screen. My strength is that I love challenges, solving problems and learning things.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
              <p>I want to learn how to listen and when to talk. Normally I talk too much and don't listen enough.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
            
          
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <p>To work productively in the team I would treat people with respect, keep my promises and work hard to have my part of the work done when others rely on me. I would be punctual and make sure we were all on the same page.</p>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
              <p><s>I would cry</s> I would meditate and go to the gym to get rid of stress, and most important I would make sure that my negative mood or state of mind <b>doesn't affect people around me</b>.</p>
              <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
              <p>Before applying for the course I made sure my family would support me in any situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="block"><h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
            <p>I've got a lot of support from the Facilitation team already (Thank you!) and it is an amazing feeling! Another thing which I would expect from the team is honest feedback and constructive criticism. I know, it is a hard job, people don't like to say negative things and people often don't like to hear them, but I would be grateful for the opportunity to fix things which need to be fixed.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
            <p>I have commitments (who doesn't?), but before applying for the course I made sure that everyone was on board and ready to change their schedules for a couple of months.</p>

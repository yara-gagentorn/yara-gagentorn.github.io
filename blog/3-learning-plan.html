            <div class="block"><h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
              <p>I want to get into web development industry and I want to stay there as long as I can. I want to find <i>my</i> place  and get an opportunity to make people's lives better, easier, more enjoable.  </p>

            <div class="block"><h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
            
          
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
              <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
          </div>
          <div class="block"><h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
          </div>
          
          <h4>What is HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <div class="code-snippet">
              <pre><code>here some &lt;p> tag</code></pre>
            </div>
          <h4>Why styles are important?</h4>
          <p>They say the information is the most powerful thing in the world. I say the presentation of the information as much as important as the information itself. If I hand you over a piece of paper with a winning lottery number, but this number is written with bad (like doctor-bad) handwriting you will not be able to understand a thing. </p>

          <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
          
            <div class="block"><h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
              <p>I want to get into web development industry and I want to stay there as long as I can. I want to find <i>my</i> place  and get an opportunity to make people's lives better, easier and more enjoyable.  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
              <p>My language is the limitation when it is time to  write something. Compare with an average person, it takes more time and affords for me to put my thoughts on the paper/screen. My strength is that I love challenges, solving problems and learning things.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
              <p>I want to learn how to listen and when to talk. Normally I talk too much and don't listen enough.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="block"><h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h4>
            
          
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
              <p>To work productively in the team I would treat people with respect, keep my promises and work hard to have my part of the work done when others rely on me. I would be punctual and make sure we were all on the same page.</p>
              <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
              <p><s>I would cry</s> I would meditate and go to the gym to get rid of stress, and most important I would make sure that my negative mood or state of mind <b>doesn't affect people around me</b>.</p>
              <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
              <p>Before applying for the course I made sure my family would support me in any situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="block"><h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
            <p>I've got a lot of support from the Facilitation team already (Thank you!) and it is an amazing feeling! Another thing which I would expect from the team is honest feedback and constructive criticism. I know, it is a hard job, people don't like to say negative things and people often don't like to hear them, but I would be grateful for the opportunity to fix things which need to be fixed.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
            <p>I have commitments (who doesn't?), but before applying for the course I made sure that everyone was on board and ready to change their schedules for a couple of months.</p>

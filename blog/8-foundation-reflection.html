          <h3>Foundation Reflection</h3>
          <div class="block"><h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
          </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I’ve been limiting myself by thinking “I am not good at ...”</li>
              <li>My ego tells me to jump in with advice before I actually understand the problem.</li>
              <li>One of the most important things is to make people around you feel comfortable in your company.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <p>
              Self-awareness is important in programming because the productivity of each of us depends on many aspects - how well we rest, how stressed we are, how tired, hungry, happy etc. To be a good programmer person needs to understand and manage themself very well. Values and empathy are things that are important in every workplace, they let build a foundation for a great teamwork.  
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
            <p>
              The main surprise was realizing how important are soft skills and how important to actually learn about them. Normally people, including me, think “well I am a nice person and I don’t have a problem in communication”, and the realization “well, I am not as good as I think”  is a bitter pillow to swallow, especially if you are not a young person. This realization is opening a door to a better version of yourself.
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            <p>
              To really open up and realize that it is never too late to change.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
            <p>
              Because you guys can see things that are hidden from the people outside of the industry and understand the importance of the core skills in the workplace.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="block"><h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <p>
              Studying core is an interesting journey that never ends and it is never a waste of time. I am pretty sure each of us will need to learn a lot in the workplace anyway and to make this learning easier we need to be team players and decent human beings. Even if some of us choose a different career path, core skills are universal and applicable to any life situation.

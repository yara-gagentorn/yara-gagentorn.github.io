            <h4><a href="">What is HTML and CSS?</a></h4>
            <h4><a href="">Why styles are important?</a></h4>

          <h4>What is HTML and CSS?</h4>
          <p>People say the information is the most powerful thing in the world. I say the presentation of the information as much as important as the information itself. If I give you a piece of paper with a winning lottery number, but this number is written with a bad handwriting you will not be able to understand a thing and you will not actually <i>get</i> an information, just a bad representation of it. </p>
          <div class="blog-img-place">
            <a href="https://www.writechoice.co.in/writechoice/bad-ugly-handwriting/"><img class="blog-img-source" src="../media/link-out.png" alt="Link to the source"></a>
            <img class="blog-img" src="../media/handwriting.jpg" alt="bad handwriting">
            <p class="blog-img-text"><span >There is the answer on the main question of life and Universe...</span></p>
          </div>
          <p>The main purpose of the Internet is to share and get information. In real life we share information through books, papers, letters, notes etc, on the Internet we need something different, something digital. Yes, you can just put your text into a file, call it "something.html" and put in to the Internet, people will be able to open it in the browser and read it, but... <a href="./something.html">Just look at this!</a></p>
          <div class="blog-img-place">
            <a href="./something.html"><img class="blog-img-source" src="../media/link-out.png" alt="Link to the source"></a>
            <img class="blog-img" src="../media/no-html.png" alt="no html">
            <p class="blog-img-text">Good information, bad representation</p>
          </div>


            
            <p>It is not easy to read and comprehend information in this format. And that is why we have HTML - HyperText Markup Language. HTML uses tags to tell a browser how to structure the information. Most of tags have opening and closing tags (this way you can mark beginning and end of element).</p>
            <p>This tag &lt;p> we use to let know the browser that this piece of data is a paragraph and it needs to be separated.
              With this tag &lt;h1> we show that there is a heading and it needs to be different from a paragraph. Tag &lt;div> we use as a container, we can put a heading and a few paragraphs inside of it. Here is an example of HTML code:</p>
            <div class="code-snippet"> 
<pre><code><span class="for-tag">&lt;h1></span>I am a heading!<span class="for-tag">&lt;/h1></span>
<span class="for-tag">&lt;p></span> I am a paragraph. I am longer than the heading and 
I contain a lot of very valuble and useful information.<span class="for-tag">&lt;/p></span></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>And how it looks in the browser:</p>
            <div class="blog-img-place">
              
              <img class="blog-img" src="../media/with-html.png" alt=" html">
              <p class="blog-img-text"></p>
            </div>
            <p>With HTML we get a piece of structured information. It is good enough, but what if we want to change the font? Or colour? Or the position of the element on the page? It is time to meet CSS (Cascading Style Sheets ). We use CSS to style our HTML page and there are a few ways to do it.</p>
<p>The most obvious way - you find an opening tag of the element in your html code and give this element some style.Right there, inside of the opening tag:</p>  
<div class="code-snippet">
<pre><code><span class="for-tag">&lt;h1 style="color:red; font-size: 16px;"></span>I am a heading!<span class="for-tag">&lt;/h1></span>
<span class="for-tag">&lt;p style="color: blue;"></span> I am a paragraph. I am longer than the heading and 
I contain a lot of very valuble and useful information.<span class="for-tag">&lt;/p></span></code></pre>  
</div>

<p>And it is working:</p>

<div class="blog-img-place">         
  <img class="blog-img" src="../media/html-inline-styles.png" alt=" html">
  <p class="blog-img-text"></p>
</div>

  <p> This way (it calls "inline styles") totally makes sense if you have one html-page with one element of each type (one paragraph, one picture, one heading etc). If you have two paragraphs you would need to put <span class="for-tag">style=""</span> attribute to each of them and if you want both paragraphs have the same appearance you would need to repet youself. More elements you have more bulky your code become. 
    </p>
    <div class="blog-img-place">         
      <img class="blog-img" src="../media/inline-styles-many.png" alt=" many inline styles">
      <p class="blog-img-text">Beauty of the inline styles</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Hey, do you remember about the importance of the presentation? It works for web developers too! Just imagine you decided to change a font size for all of your  <span class="for-tag">&lt;p></span> elements. If you have ten  <span class="for-tag">&lt;p></span> elements on your page you WILL make a mistake somewhere, I promise. </p> 
  <p>It would make sence to describe the style once and them just refer it every time when you want to use it. And here we've just invented <span class="for-tag"><b>class</b></span>. Now all you need is to put <span class="for-tag">class="name_of_my_amazing_style"</span> inside each openening tag of the element you want to style and describe this style somewhere. Again, it makes sence to describe this style right in your html page, but what if you have 34 styles? It is a lot of code for one page.</p>

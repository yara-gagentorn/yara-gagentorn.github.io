          <p>Now I am looking for a permanent place in the New Zealand IT industry. I am passionate about technologies and how to make them more accessible for everyone. </p>
          <!--p>There is one important thing which I need to explain. Do you see those rectangles on the left (you will not see them on the mobile phone), which are a little bit outside of the another rectangle? This is not a bug, this is a feature. I totally know how to work with margin (no) and I am capable of arranging the elements the way I want (also no). CSS is easy (it's hard) and predictable (ha.ha.ha.)</p-->
